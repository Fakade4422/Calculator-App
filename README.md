# Calculator-App
React.js Calculator App
This repository consists of a basic Calculator App. The app was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and React.js. This was my first official attempt to create a project after a few trial and error
of trying to integrate React into my process of creating software/apps. I've always used C#.net, Html, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript to create software this was my introduction into using REACT.JS .
